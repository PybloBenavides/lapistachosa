# GitHub Pages Pelican Build Action Demo

This GitHub repository is used to demonstrate the [GitHub Pages Pelican Build Action][action].

Please see the [action's page][action] for more information.

This demonstration site is deployed to GitHub Pages and a custom domain name is pointed at it: 

https://pelican-action-demo.mindflakes.com/

The custom domain was optional and is there so I don't have to fiddle with the stock theme to fix the URLs for resources.
